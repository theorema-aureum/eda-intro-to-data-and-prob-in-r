# eda-intro-to-data-and-prob-in-r
A code repository for my project for the completion of the Duke University Data Analysis with R Specialization - Introduction to Data and Probability with R certificate hosted by Coursera. 

Below is the project description from Coursera:
"For this summary project, you’ll need to utilize all the skills you’ve gained throughout the duration of this course. In this project, you will identify three research questions similar to questions we’ve talked about in this course. Use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset (provided below)."

This repository includes the dataset as a CSV file and my completed exploratory data analysis as an R Markdown file. Output can be found in the link to RPubs in my profile.
